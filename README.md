# myTorch: This is part of my CMU 11785 course 

a custom light deep learning library developed from scratch similar to PyTorch or Tensorflow that includes :
1) Autograd: a functioning Autograd library
2) MLPs    : an MLP library with linear, ReLU layers 
3)  Convolutional Network Components: e forward and backward passes of a 1D convolutional layer and a flattening layer
4)  CNNs as Scanning MLPs: converting a linear scanning MLP to a CNN
5)  RNN
6)  GRU
